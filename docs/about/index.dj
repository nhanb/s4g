This is a sample website to demonstrate some features of [WebMaker2000][1].
It also doubles as a lazy end-to-end test suite until the core design
stablizes.

Right now we have:

- [Autogenerated home index](..)
- [{-RSS-} Atom feed](../feed.xml)
- [Per-article custom theme](../scale/)

The articles themselves are just, uh, _colorful_ lorem ipsums.
Don't worry too much about their actual content.
