<p>Engineers love to talk about scalability.  It makes us feel like the bad ass,
dick-swingin’ motherfuckers that we wish we could be.</p>
<p>After we talk about scalability with our co-workers (<em>Yeah, Rails doesn’t
scale!</em>), we flex our true engineering prowess by writing a post about it on
our blog.  Once that post hits Reddit, son, everyone will know how hardcore you
really are.  Respect.</p>

<h2>People Who Talk Big About Scalability Don’t Need To Worry About It<a href="#People-Who-Talk-Big-About-Scalability-Don-t-Need-To-Worry-About-It" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>Fact:  every chest-thumping blog post I have seen written about scalability is
either about architecture, Memcached, or both.  Some asshole who writes shitty
code starts pontificating about <em>“scalable architecture”</em> with data storage,
web frontends, whatever-the-fuck.  Dude, your app isn’t having scalability
problems because of the <em>architecture</em>.  It’s having scalability problems
because you coded a ton of N^2 loops into it and you’re too self-important to
get peer reviews on your commits.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget the tools who discover Memcached for the first time,
install it on a web server, and notice how fast their app runs now.  Yeah,
welcome to the modern age.  Hope you know what a cache expiry policy is.</p>

<h2>If You Haven’t Discussed Capacity Planning, You Can’t Discuss Scalability<a href="#If-You-Haven-t-Discussed-Capacity-Planning-You-Can-t-Discuss-Scalability" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>You don’t need to worry about scalability on your Rails-over-Mysql application
because nobody is going to use it.  Really.  Believe me.  You’re going to get,
at most, 1,000 people on your app, and maybe 1% of them will be 7-day active.
Scalability is not your problem, getting people to give a shit is.</p>
<p>Unless you know what you need to scale <em>to</em>, you can’t even begin to talk about
scalability.  How many users do you want your system to handle? A thousand?
Hundred thousand? Ten million?  Here’s a hint: the system you design to handle
a quarter million users is going to be different from the system you design to
handle ten million users.</p>
<p>Of course you’ll point to the engineer’s wet dream: linear scalability.  <em>Lulz
but when we get more users we just add more machines you are so stupid ted.
uncov sucks.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, great, well it doesn’t exist.  Oh no, go ahead and try out Amazon
SimpleDB and think to yourself that it will scale linearly.  Then, when you get
enough users that the latency becomes a problem, blame it on “those shitty
Amazon datacenters”.</p>

<h2>Choosing Technology Don’t Mean Shit If You Don’t Know How To Use It<a href="#Choosing-Technology-Don-t-Mean-Shit-If-You-Don-t-Know-How-To-Use-It" class="heading-link">#</a></h2>
<p>The most common butthurt about scalability is this:  choose a technology.  If
you like the technology, claim <em>“technology X scales better!”</em> If you don’t
like it, claim <em>“technology X doesn’t scale!”</em></p>
<p>Saying “Rails doesn’t scale” is like saying “my car doesn’t go infinitely
fast”.  Alternatively, saying “We’ll have no problems scaling because we’re
using Django” is like saying “I will win every race because my car is the most
powerful”.  Maybe so, but you suck at driving, and you’re up against
professionals.</p>
<p>If you’re having scalability problems and blaming it on a single technology,
chances are, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
